This is a modified version of one of the F#Â scripts in Kreylo's for the AR sandbox, aiming at displaying erosion & sedimentation.
We have edited Kreylos' ARSandbox code to visually enhance the erosion and sedimentation produced by water during 3D motion and its role in shaping the landscape and topography. 


This is a modification of version SARndbox-1.5-001

How to use it:
Replace the file with the same name in the original sarndbox code (folder 'shaders') by this one. No need for recompiling:


./SARndbox-1.5-001/share/SARndbox-1.5/Shaders/
