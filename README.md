This is a modified version of one of the F#Â scripts in Kreylo's for the AR sandbox, aiming at displaying erosion & sedimentation.
We have edited Kreylos' ARSandbox code to visually enhance the erosion and sedimentation produced by water during 3D motion and its role in shaping the landscape and topography.
